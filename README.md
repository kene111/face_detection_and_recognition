# face_detection_and_recognition

This is a  model built for a project that is being worked on, although currently on pause. The model works fine but
can and will still be improved upon.

 For a certain error that occurs when you run this line of code 'cv2.face.LBPHFaceRecognizer_create()' 
 use this --> 'pip install opencv-contrib-python --user' to solve it.
